# Clustering algorithm implementaion and visualization from scratch with python

Three popular clustering algorithms (for d >= 2 dimensions, k >= 2 clusters):
(1) k-means
(2) EM-GMM (Gaussian mixture model - expectation maximization)
(3) mean-shift

Python implementations:
KMeans.py: k-means
GaussianMM.py: EM-GMM (Gaussian mixture model - expectation maximization)
GaussianMM_Ver0.py: another version for EM-GMM (Gaussian mixture model - expectation maximization)
MeanShift.py: mean-shift
MeanShift_Ver0.py: another version for mean-shift

Test on 2D datasets for visualization, compared with sklearn implementation:
(1) blobs pattern
(2) sticks pattern
(3) moon and stars pattern
