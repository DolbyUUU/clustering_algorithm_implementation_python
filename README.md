# Clustering algorithm implementaion and visualization from scratch with python

Three popular clustering algorithms (for d >= 2 dimensions, k >= 2 clusters):  

- (1) k-means  
- (2) EM-GMM (Gaussian mixture model - expectation maximization algorithm)  
- (3) mean-shift  

Python implementations:  

- KMeans.py: k-means  
- GaussianMM.py: EM-GMM
- GaussianMM_Ver0.py: another version of EM-GMM implementation, with AIC, BIC and predict  
- MeanShift.py: mean-shift  

Evaluations and tests:  
- test_2d_visualization.py: tests on 2D datasets with visualization, compared with sklearn implementation  
- data_2d_test folder: datasets for tests  
- test_2d_visualization_results folder: output images of tests
